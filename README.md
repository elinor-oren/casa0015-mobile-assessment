##  Credits 
- I used ChatGPT to reformat, comment, and structure my code. I generated my logo with the DALL-E model.
- I drew heavily on this medium [walkthrough](https://betterprogramming.pub/measuring-your-heart-rate-using-your-phones-camera-and-flutter-f444d3c4272a) to process the image for heart rate collection.
